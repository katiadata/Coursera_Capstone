# Data
To achieve the study goals, I will need information about the available venues with their addresses, and the Parisian area zip codes and coordinates to attribute them to the correct neighbourhoods.
The names, zip codes and geographic coordinates of the neighbourhoods are in open access at the French governmental web site: https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/base-officielle-des-codes-postaux/
I will use the venue information from the Foursquare database.
