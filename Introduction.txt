Introduction/Business Problem
Living in such a multi-cultural and deeply historical city as Paris is extremely interesting, but it can be not easy. One has to choose the neighbourhood to live in carefully. I am not renting an apartment in a lovely Parisian suburb, but looking for a place of my own. I would love to stay in the same neighbourhood, but as the offer is not that big, so I have to consider other options as well. I want to find a perfect area resembling the one I'm living in now. 
To do so, I will use the Foursquare data and cluster the neighbourhoods with respect to the available venues and activities.
Even though I design this study for my own purposes, its results will be useful for any other person living in Paris and looking for their perfect place to live.
